# connect
Major Work project completed during the Year 12 (2021) Software Design and Development HSC course. <br /><br />
Demonstrates C# Winforms, AWS EC2 and Adobe Photoshop. Use of Amazon Elastic Compute Cloud allows the C# application to draw from a central database accessed using PuTTY.<br />
Not currently maintained or updated since 2021.

#comments
EC2 details (user address, userid, password and database name) have been removed and the connection string (cs) is an empty string. <b>Therefore, this application will produce a runtime error attempting to connect to the SQL database and not work</b>.
